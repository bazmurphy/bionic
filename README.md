This was a quick project to help someone with Dyslexia test their Reading Speed with the concept of Bionic Reading applied to any text that was copy/pasted into the Input Box, and allowing a few adjustable parameters applied to the Output in the form of letter spacing and line height.

The technical part was writing an algorithm to apply the correct bold emphasis on the start of any length of word that comes in.
